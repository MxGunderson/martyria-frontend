                    <p>“Then I heard a triumphant voice in heaven proclaiming: “Now salvation and power are set in place, and the kingdom reign of our God and the ruling authority of his Anointed One are established. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who relentlessly accused them day and night before our God, has now been defeated —cast out once and for all! They conquered him completely through the blood of the Lamb and the powerful word of his testimony. They triumphed because they did not love and cling to their own lives, even when faced with death.” Revelation‬ ‭12:10-11‬</p>

                    <p>Martyria was created by believers for believers. We honor God by trusting in faith that He has sent us to share His good news. Here, sons and daughters are able to share what's going on their lives and encourage others with testimonies, scripture, and over building up in faith. We are called to love, encourage, and worship our creator. Join us as we celebrate all that He does for us.  </p>
